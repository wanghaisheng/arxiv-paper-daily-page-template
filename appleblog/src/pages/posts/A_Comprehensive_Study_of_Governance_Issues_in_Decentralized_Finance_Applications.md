## abstracts:
Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a prominent application of smart contracts, representing a novel financial paradigm in contrast to centralized finance. While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of smart contract governance. This paper presents a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research papers, we develop a governance taxonomy to examine these issues. We collect and analyze 4,446 audit reports from 17 reputable Web3 security companies, categorizing the governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. In addition, we identify vulnerabilities in the governance design and implementation processes, e.g., flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. To aid in the identification of the main topics of governance issues, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Moreover, we explore the challenges associated with maintaining consistency between the code and the whitepaper in DeFi applications, providing valuable insights for addressing this issue in the future. We build a prototype tool based on artificial intelligence (AI), representing an initial attempt to uncover potential solutions. We validate this prototype across eight DeFi projects, achieving a 56.14% F1 score and a 80% recall. Through this study, we expect to assist the design and development teams of DeFi applications, as well as users, researchers, and regulators, in better understanding and addressing governance challenges, thereby fostering the healthy development of DeFi.
