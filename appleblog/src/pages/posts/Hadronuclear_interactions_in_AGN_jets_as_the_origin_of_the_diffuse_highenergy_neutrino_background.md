## abstracts:
The origin of diffuse high-energy neutrinos from TeV to PeV energies detected by IceCube Observatory remains a mystery. In our previous work, we have shown that hadronuclear (p-p) interactions in AGN jets could be important and generate detectable very-high-energy emissions. Here, we further explore these interactions in the AGN jets based on their luminosity function. The diffuse neutrino flux and corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux have been calculated and compared with observational data. In our modeling, two beaming patterns are considered separately. To make sure that the corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux does not overshoot the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background, we find that if the neutrino production region in jet is opaque to $\gamma$ rays, p-p interactions in AGN jets with a small viewing angle (the blazar case) are able to interpret the PeV neutrino background. Similarly, AGN jets with a large viewing angle (the radio galaxy case) may interpret the TeV neutrino background. While, if the neutrino production region is transparent to $\gamma$ rays, only blazars have the potential to interpret the DNB around PeV band. Some caveats are also discussed.
