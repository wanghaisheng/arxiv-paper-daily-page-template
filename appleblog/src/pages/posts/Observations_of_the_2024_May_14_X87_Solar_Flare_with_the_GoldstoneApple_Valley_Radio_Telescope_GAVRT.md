## abstracts:
The Goldstone-Apple Valley Radio Telescope (GAVRT) project conducts a regular monitoring program of the Sun. The GAVRT Solar Patrol project uses a 34 m diameter antenna to produce raster-scan maps of the Sun simultaneously at 4 frequencies ranging from approximately 3 GHz to 14 GHz. On 2024 May 14, as part of regular GAVRT Solar Patrol observations, raster maps were produced when an X8.7 solar flare occurred in active region AR13664. Here we present the GAVRT maps of the May 14 flare along with microwave flux density spectra showing the non-thermal microwave burst emission from mildly relativistic electrons produced in this largest flare of Solar Cycle 25 to date. AR13664 reappeared as AR13697 and continued to be very active, producing X flares while GAVRT monitored its activity. GAVRT microwave data provide a powerful complement to the energetic electrons tracked by X-ray, millimeter-wave and {\gamma}-ray emissions.
