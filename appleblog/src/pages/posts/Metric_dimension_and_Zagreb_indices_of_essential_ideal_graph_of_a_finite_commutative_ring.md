## abstracts:
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity. The essential ideal graph $\mathcal{E}_{R}$ of $R$ is a graph whose vertex set consists of all nonzero proper ideals of \textit{R}. Two vertices $\hat{I}$ and $\hat{J}$ are adjacent if and only if $\hat{I}+ \hat{J}$ is an essential ideal. In this paper, we characterize the graph $\mathcal{E}_{R}$ as having a finite metric dimension.   Additionally, we identify that the essential ideal graph and annihilating ideal graph of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ are isomorphic whenever $n$ is a product of distinct primes. Also, we estimate the metric dimension of the essential ideal graph of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Furthermore, we determine the topological indices, namely the first and the second Zagreb indices, of $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbb Z_n}$.
