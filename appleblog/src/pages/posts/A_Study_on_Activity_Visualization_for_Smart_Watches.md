## abstracts:
This paper investigates the use of visualization to display activity data on smartwatches by surveying the data visual presentations proposed by 80 smartwatch models currently available on the Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com and, later, surveying the preferences of 41 users concerning these visualizations. The results show that despite radial bar charts are the most popular visualization for activity data on smartwatches, the users' preferences might be influenced by their familiarity with these charts. These findings from this survey will be valuable for designers, developers, and researchers who are interested in creating innovative and effective solutions for activity visualization on smartwatches.
## QA:
coming soon
