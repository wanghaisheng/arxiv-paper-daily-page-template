## abstracts:
Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) will be an indispensable ingredient in future quantum technologies. For example, large-scale fibre-based quantum networks will require QFC to interconnect heterogeneous building blocks like emitters, channels, memories and detectors. The performance of existing QFC devices - typically realised in periodically-poled nonlinear crystals - is often severely limited by parasitic noise that arises when the pump wavelength lies between the wavelengths which are inter-converted. Here we investigate the noise spectrum of a frequency converter pumped by a CW 1064 nm laser. The converter was realised as a monolithic bulk pump enhancement cavity made from a periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (ppKTP) crystal - quasi-phase-matched for the conversion of 637 nm to 1587 nm. In the range from 1140 nm to 1330 nm (up to 60 THz from the pump) Stokes-Raman resonances can be identified as the dominant noise source while the noise in the range from 1330 nm to 1650 nm can be attributed mainly to parasitic spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Further, a succession of narrow-band peaks is observed in the spectrum originating from higher-order counter-propagating SPDC. Both types of counter-propagation, where either the lower-energy idler photon or the higher-energy signal photon counter-propagate relative to the pump beam, are observed, with narrow-band peaks corresponding to 10th to 44th order quasi-phase-matching.
