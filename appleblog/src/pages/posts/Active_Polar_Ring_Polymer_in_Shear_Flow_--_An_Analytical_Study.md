## abstracts:
We theoretically study the conformational and dynamical properties of semiflexible active polar ring polymers under linear shear flow. A ring is described as a continuous Gaussian polymer with a tangential active force of a constant density along its contour. The linear but non-Hermitian equation of motion is solved using an eigenfunction expansion, which yields activity-independent, but shear-rate-dependent, relaxation times and activity-dependent frequencies. As a consequence, the ring's stationary-state properties are independent of activity, and its conformations as well as rheological properties are equal to those of a passive ring under shear. The presence of characteristic time scales by the relaxation and the frequency gives rise to a particular dynamical behavior. A tank-treading-like motion emerges for large relaxation times and high frequencies, specifically for stiffer rings, governed by the activity-dependent frequencies. In the case of very flexible polymers, the relaxation behavior dominates over tank-treading. Shear strongly affects the crossover from a tank-treading to a relaxation-time dominated dynamics and suppresses tank-treading. This is reflected in the tumbling frequency, which exhibits two shear-rate dependent regimes, with an activity-dependent plateau at low shear rates followed by a power-law regime with increasing tumbling frequency for large shear rates.
