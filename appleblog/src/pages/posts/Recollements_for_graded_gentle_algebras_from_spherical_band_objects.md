## abstracts:
In this paper we study the localization of a derived category of a graded gentle algebra by a subcategory generated by a spherical band object. This object corresponds to a simple closed curve under the equivalence between the perfect derived category of the graded gentle algebra and the partially wrapped Fukaya category of the associated graded marked surface, as established by Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich.   We describe this localization as a recollement that involves the derived category of a new graded algebra given by quiver and relations. This leads us to the introduction of the class of graded pinched gentle algebras, a generalization of graded gentle algebras. We then show that these algebras are in bijection with graded marked surfaces with conical singularities. Moreover, under this correspondence the localization process amounts to the contraction of the closed curve.
