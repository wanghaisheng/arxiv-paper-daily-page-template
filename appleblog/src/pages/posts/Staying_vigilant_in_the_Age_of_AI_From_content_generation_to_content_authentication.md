## abstracts:
This paper presents the Yangtze Sea project, an initiative in the battle against Generative AI (GAI)-generated fake con-tent. Addressing a pressing issue in the digital age, we investigate public reactions to AI-created fabrications through a structured experiment on a simulated academic conference platform. Our findings indicate a profound public challenge in discerning such content, highlighted by GAI's capacity for realistic fabrications. To counter this, we introduce an innovative approach employing large language models like ChatGPT for truthfulness assess-ment. We detail a specific workflow for scrutinizing the authenticity of everyday digital content, aimed at boosting public awareness and capability in identifying fake mate-rials. We apply this workflow to an agent bot on Telegram to help users identify the authenticity of text content through conversations. Our project encapsulates a two-pronged strategy: generating fake content to understand its dynamics and developing assessment techniques to mitigate its impact. As part of that effort we propose the creation of speculative fact-checking wearables in the shape of reading glasses and a clip-on. As a computational media art initiative, this project under-scores the delicate interplay between technological progress, ethical consid-erations, and societal consciousness.
