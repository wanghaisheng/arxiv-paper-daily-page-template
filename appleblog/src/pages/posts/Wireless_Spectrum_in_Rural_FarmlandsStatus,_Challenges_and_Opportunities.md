## abstracts:
Due to factors such as low population density and expansive geographical distances, network deployment falls behind in rural regions, leading to a broadband divide. Wireless spectrum serves as the blood and flesh of wireless communications. Shared white spaces such as those in the TVWS and CBRS spectrum bands offer opportunities to expand connectivity, innovate, and provide affordable access to high-speed Internet in under-served areas without additional cost to expensive licensed spectrum. However, the current methods to utilize these white spaces are inefficient due to very conservative models and spectrum policies, causing under-utilization of valuable spectrum resources. This hampers the full potential of innovative wireless technologies that could benefit farmers, small Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) operating in rural regions. This study explores the challenges faced by farmers and service providers when using shared spectrum bands to deploy their networks while ensuring maximum system performance and minimizing interference with other users. Additionally, we discuss how spatiotemporal spectrum models, in conjunction with database-driven spectrum-sharing solutions, can enhance the allocation and management of spectrum resources, ultimately improving the efficiency and reliability of wireless networks operating in shared spectrum bands.
