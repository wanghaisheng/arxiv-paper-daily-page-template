## abstracts:
Chiral carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are direct-gap semiconductors with optical properties governed by one-dimensional excitons with enormous oscillator strengths. Each species of chiral CNTs has an enantiomeric pair of left- and right-handed CNTs with nearly identical properties, but enantiomer-dependent phenomena can emerge, especially in nonlinear optical processes. Theoretical studies have predicted strong second-order nonlinearities for chiral CNTs, but there has been no experimental verification due to the lack of macroscopically ordered assemblies of single-enantiomer chiral CNTs. Here for the first time, we report the synthesis of centimeter-scale films of densely packed and aligned single-enantiomer chiral CNTs that exhibit micro-fabrication compatibility. We observe giant second harmonic generation (SHG) emission from the chiral CNT film, which originates from the intrinsic chirality and inversion symmetry breaking of the atomic structure of chiral CNTs. The observed value of the dominant element of the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor reaches $1.5\times 10^{3}$ pm/V at a pump wavelength of 1030 nm, corresponding to the lowest-energy excitonic resonance. Our calculations based on many-body theory correctly estimate the spectrum and magnitude of such excitonically enhanced optical nonlinearity. These results are promising for developing scalable chiral-CNT electronics, nonlinear photonics and photonic quantum computing.
