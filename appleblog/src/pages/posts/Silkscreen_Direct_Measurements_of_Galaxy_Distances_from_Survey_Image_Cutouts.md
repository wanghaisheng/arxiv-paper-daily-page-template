## abstracts:
With upcoming wide field surveys from the ground and space the number of known dwarf galaxies at $\lesssim 25$ Mpc is expected to dramatically increase. Insight into their nature and analyses of these systems' intrinsic properties will rely on reliable distance estimates. Traditional techniques such as tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) or surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) are limited in their widespread applicability, especially in the semi-resolved regime. In this work we turn to the rapidly growing field of simulation based inference to infer distances, and other physical properties, of dwarf galaxies directly from multi-band images. We introduce Silkscreen: a code leveraging neural posterior estimation to infer the posterior distribution of parameters while simultaneously training a convolutional neural network to extract summary statistics from the images. Utilizing this combination of machine learning and Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the method's ability to recover accurate distances from ground-based survey images for a set of nearby galaxies ($2 < D ({\rm Mpc)} < 12$) with measured SBF or TRGB distances. We discuss caveats of the current implementation along with future prospects, focusing on the goal of amortized inference. For surveys like LSST, Silkscreen, once amortized, will facilitate inference for new dwarf galaxies in a matter of seconds using only broadband cutouts. While we focus here on dwarf galaxies, we note that this method can be generalized to more luminous systems as well.
