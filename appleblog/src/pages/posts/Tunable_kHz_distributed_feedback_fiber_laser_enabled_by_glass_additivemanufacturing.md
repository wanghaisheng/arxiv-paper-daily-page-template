## abstracts:
For short sections of fibers tailored to a specific application, fast laser-based manufacturing techniques can be an attractive alternative to the often-cumbersome traditional manufacturing routes. Short, high gain fibers can be used in e.g., distributed feedback fiber lasers (DFFL) that offer sought after performance suitable for a broad range of applications in modern photonics. DFFLs offer superior stability and narrower linewidth compared to conventional fiber lasers. Tunable, narrow laser sources with output in eye-safe spectrum are desired for sensing, signal multiplexing, LIDAR systems etc. In this work we present DFFL obtained using Laser-Powder-Deposition made Er-doped silica fiber. Milliwatt level, ultra-narrow laser line (less than 4 kHz) was obtained using phase-shifted grating in 16 mm long fiber. The backward slope efficiency was as high as 24% when pumping at 976 nm. The results presented in this work showcase new possibilities in fiber fabrication that were unlocked through laser-assisted AM. This fiber laser sets the stage for the future of rapid fabrication of advanced fiber devices through unconventional manufacturing routes.
