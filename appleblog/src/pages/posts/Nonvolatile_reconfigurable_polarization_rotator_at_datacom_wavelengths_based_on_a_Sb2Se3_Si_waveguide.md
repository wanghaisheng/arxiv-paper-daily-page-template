## abstracts:
Silicon photonics has become a key platform for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its high refractive index and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing. However, the inherent birefringence in silicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report a reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide operating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching with zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the interference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured by changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our experimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a polarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as -0.08 dB and 17.65 dB, respectively, in a compact footprint of just 21$\mu$m length. Therefore, the proposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for polarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in data communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from polarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum computing.
