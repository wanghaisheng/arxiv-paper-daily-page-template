## abstracts:
We consider some distinguished classes of elements of a multiplicative lattice endowed with coarse lower topologies, and call them lower spaces. The primary objective of this paper is to study the topological properties of these lower spaces, encompassing lower separation axioms and compactness. We characterize lower spaces that exhibit sobriety. Introducing the concept of strongly disconnected spaces, we establish a correlation between strongly disconnected lower spaces and the presence of nontrivial idempotent elements in the corresponding multiplicative lattices. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for a lower space to be connected. We prove that the lower space of proper elements is a spectral space, and we further explore continuous maps between lower spaces.
