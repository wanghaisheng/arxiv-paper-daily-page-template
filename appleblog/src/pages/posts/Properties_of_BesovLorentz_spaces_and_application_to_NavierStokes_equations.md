## abstracts:
Inspired by Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg, Fefferman and Lin, we try to investigate how to control the set of large value points for the strong solution of Navier-Stokes equations. Besov-Lorentz spaces have multiple indices which can reflect complex changes of the set of the large value points. Hence we consider some properties of Gauss flow, paraproduct flow and couple flow related to the Besov-Lorentz spaces. When dealing with Lorentz index, we use wavelets and maximum norm to describe the decay situation in the binary time ring and to define time-frequency microlocal maximum norm space. We use maximum operator, $\alpha$-triangle inequality and H\"older inequality etc to get accurate estimates. As an application, we get a global wellposedness result of the Navier-Stokes equations where the solution can reflect how the size of the set of large value points changes.
