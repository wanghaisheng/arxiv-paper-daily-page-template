## abstracts:
We study the copolynomials of $n$ variables, i.e. $K$-linear mappings from the ring of polynomials $K[x_1,...,x_n]$ into the commutative ring $K$.   We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for a linear differential equation of infinite order which can be considered as an algebraic version of the classical Malgrange-Ehrenpreis theorem for the existence of the fundamental solution of a linear differential operator with constant coefficients. We find the fundamental solutions of linear differential operators of infinite order and show that the unique solution of the corresponding inhomogeneous equation can be represented as a convolution of the fundamental solution of this operator and the right-hand side. We also prove the existence and uniqueness theorem of the Cauchy problem for some linear differential equations in the module of formal power series with copolynomial coefficients.
