## abstracts:
Cubic and biquadratic reciprocity have long since been referred to as "the forgotten reciprocity laws", largely since they provide special conditions that are widely considered to be unnecessary in the study of number theory. In this exposition of finite fields and higher reciprocity, we will begin by introducing concepts in abstract algebra and elementary number theory. This will motivate our approach toward understanding the structure and then existence of finite fields, especially with a focus on understanding the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}^{*}$. While surveying finite fields we will provide another proof of quadratic reciprocity. We will proceed to investigate properties of the general multiplicative character, covering the concept of a general Gauss sum as well as basic notions of the Jacobi sum. From there we will begin laying the foundations for the cubic reciprocity law, beginning with a classification of the primes and units of the Eisenstein integers, denoted $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$, and further investigations into the residue class ring $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]/\pi\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ for $\pi$ prime, which is predominantly the world in which cubic reciprocity lies. We then define the general multiplicative character and state the full law of cubic reciprocity. We will finish the section on cubic reciprocity with a brief survey of the cubic residue character of the even prime $2$ and state a significant result due to Gauss that summarizes the conditions for $2$ to be a cubic residue. We conclude with a brief survey of the law of biquadratic reciprocity.
