|**2024-07-05**|**Lower spaces of multiplicative lattices**|Amartya Goswami et.al.|[2407.04665v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04665v1)|null|We consider some distinguished classes of elements of a multiplicative lattice endowed with coarse lower topologies, and call them lower spaces. The primary objective of this paper is to study the topological properties of these lower spaces, encompassing lower separation axioms and compactness. We characterize lower spaces that exhibit sobriety. Introducing the concept of strongly disconnected spaces, we establish a correlation between strongly disconnected lower spaces and the presence of nontrivial idempotent elements in the corresponding multiplicative lattices. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for a lower space to be connected. We prove that the lower space of proper elements is a spectral space, and we further explore continuous maps between lower spaces.|

However, its limitations in observing small-scale changes within the central few kiloparsecs, coupled with the often observed HI deficit in galactic centers, necessitates using molecular gas emission as a preferred tracer in these regions. Understanding the dynamics of both neutral atomic and molecular gas is crucial for a more complete understanding of how galaxies evolve, funnel gas from the outer disk into their central parts, and eventually form stars. In this work we aim to quantify the dynamics of both, the neutral atomic and molecular gas, in the nearby spiral galaxies NGC 1512, NGC 4535, and NGC 7496 using new MeerKAT-HI observations together with ALMA CO (2-1) observations from the PHANGS collaboration. We use the analysis tool 3D-Barolo to fit tilted ring models to the HI and CO observations. A combined approach of using the HI to constrain the true disk orientation parameters before applying these to the CO datasets is tested. This paper sets expectations for the results of the upcoming high-resolution HI coverage of many galaxies in the PHANGS-ALMA sample using MeerKAT or VLA, to establish a robust methodology for characterizing galaxy orientations and deriving dynamics from combining new HI with existing CO data.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Constructing Noncatenary QuasiExcellent Precompletions**|Jackson Ehrenworth et.al.|[2407.04497v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04497v1)|null|Let $T$ be a local (Noetherian) ring and let $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ be prime ideals of $T$. We find sufficient conditions for there to exist a quasi-excellent local subring $B$ of $T$ satisfying the following conditions: (1) the completion of $B$ at its maximal ideal is isomorphic to the completion of $T$ at its maximal ideal, (2) $B \cap Q_1 = B \cap Q_2$, (3) the set of prime ideals of $T/(Q_1 \cap Q_2)$ of positive height is the same as the set of prime ideals of $B/(B \cap Q_1)$ of positive height when viewed as partially ordered sets, and (4) for $i = 1$ and for $i = 2$, there is a coheight preserving bijection between the minimal prime ideals of $T_{Q_i}$ and the minimal prime ideals of $B_{B \cap Q_1}$. Intuitively, this means that $T$ contains a quasi-excellent local subring in which $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are "glued together" and such that both the completion and desirable properties of the prime spectrum are preserved. We use this result to show that certain complete local rings are the completion of a quasi-excellent local ring whose prime spectrum, when viewed as a partially ordered set, contains interesting noncatenary finite subsets.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Smart Sampling Helping from Friendly Neighbors for Decentralized Federated Learning**|Lin Wang et.al.|[2407.04460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04460v1)|null|Federated Learning (FL) is gaining widespread interest for its ability to share knowledge while preserving privacy and reducing communication costs. Unlike Centralized FL, Decentralized FL (DFL) employs a network architecture that eliminates the need for a central server, allowing direct communication among clients and leading to significant communication resource savings. However, due to data heterogeneity, not all neighboring nodes contribute to enhancing the local client's model performance. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\emph{AFIND+}}, a simple yet efficient algorithm for sampling and aggregating neighbors in DFL, with the aim of leveraging collaboration to improve clients' model performance. AFIND+ identifies helpful neighbors, adaptively adjusts the number of selected neighbors, and strategically aggregates the sampled neighbors' models based on their contributions. Numerical results on real-world datasets with diverse data partitions demonstrate that AFIND+ outperforms other sampling algorithms in DFL and is compatible with most existing DFL optimization algorithms.|
|**2024-07-05**|**A combinatorial formula for the coefficients of multidimensional resultants**|Abdelmalek Abdesselam et.al.|[2407.04429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04429v1)|null|The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Gaps in the complex Farey sequence of an imaginary quadratic number field**|Rafael Sayous et.al.|[2407.04380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04380v1)|null|Given an imaginary quadratic number field $K$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, we are interested in the asymptotic \emph{distance to nearest neighbour} (or \emph{gap}) statistic of complex Farey fractions $\frac{p}{q}$, with $p,q \in \mathcal{O}_K$ and $0<|q|\leq T$, as $T \to \infty$. Reformulating this problem in a homogeneous dynamical setting, we follow the approach of J. Marklof for real Farey fractions with several variables (2013) and adapt a joint equidistribution result in the real $3$-dimensional hyperbolic space of J. Parkkonen and F. Paulin (2023) to derive the existence of a probability measure describing this asymptotic gap statistic. We obtain an integral formula for the associated cumulative distribution function, and use geometric arguments to find an explicit estimate for its tail distribution in the cases of Gaussian and Eisenstein fractions.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Glass formation in mechanically interlocked ring polymers the role of induced chain stiffness**|Jian Li et.al.|[2407.04269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04269v1)|null|Polymer-related materials exhibit rich glassy behaviors at different length scales due to their various molecular structures and topological constraints. Recent studies have identified transient interpenetration of the long-chain rings contributing to dynamic arrest on the center-of-mass level. Interpenetration of rings is proposed as an approach to facilitate glass formation in polymer melts. In this work, inspired by recent advances in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked polymers, we investigate glass transition on the nanometer-scale segments influenced by permanent interpenetration of rings using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that decreasing chain length in the mechanically interlocked system is equivalent to inducing an effective chain stiffness on the sub-rings. The induced stiffness provides a unified explanation for these unique structural features and transient dynamic arrest in the system of interlocked rings with rather short chains. Further, a crossover is observed in the scaling relation between localization and glassy depth upon cooling. Our work reveals a dynamic transition from weak to strong caging at the crossover temperature. According to the localization model, we demonstrate that the chain stiffness increases the critical temperature and oscillation distance, therefore leads to more fragile dynamics and deeper glassy state. These findings are consistent with the predictions of molecular simulations and theories for polymers with real local stiffness. Our work deepens the understanding of the role of induced stiffness on glass transition, and opens up a new direction to design rich glass materials by manipulating stiffness through mechanical bonds.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Effective Targeted Testing of Smart Contracts**|Mahdi Fooladgar et.al.|[2407.04250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04250v1)|null|Smart contracts are autonomous and immutable pieces of code that are deployed on blockchain networks and run by miners. They were first introduced by Ethereum in 2014 and have since been used for various applications such as security tokens, voting, gambling, non-fungible tokens, self-sovereign identities, stock taking, decentralized finances, decentralized exchanges, and atomic swaps. Since smart contracts are immutable, their bugs cannot be fixed, which may lead to significant monetary losses. While many researchers have focused on testing smart contracts, our recent work has highlighted a gap between test adequacy and test data generation, despite numerous efforts in both fields. Our framework, Griffin, tackles this deficiency by employing a targeted symbolic execution technique for generating test data. This tool can be used in diverse applications, such as killing the survived mutants in mutation testing, validating static analysis alarms, creating counter-examples for safety conditions, and reaching manually selected lines of code. This paper discusses how smart contracts differ from legacy software in targeted symbolic execution and how these differences can affect the tool structure, leading us to propose an enhanced version of the control-flow graph for Solidity smart contracts called CFG+. We also discuss how Griffin can utilize custom heuristics to explore the program space and find the test data that reaches a target line while considering a safety condition in a reasonable execution time. We conducted experiments involving an extensive set of smart contracts, target lines, and safety conditions based on real-world faults and test suites from related tools. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that Griffin can effectively identify the required test data within a reasonable timeframe.|
|**2024-07-05**|**A Unified Intracellular pH Landscape with SITEpHorin a QuantumEntanglementEnhanced pH Probe**|Shu-Ang Li et.al.|[2407.04232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04232v1)|null|An accurate map of intracellular organelle pH is crucial for comprehending cellular metabolism and organellar functions. However, a unified intracellular pH spectrum using a single probe is still lack. Here, we developed a novel quantum entanglement-enhanced pH-sensitive probe called SITE-pHorin, which featured a wide pH-sensitive range and ratiometric quantitative measurement capabilities. Subsequently, we measured the pH of various organelles and their sub-compartments, including mitochondrial sub-spaces, Golgi stacks, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and endosomes in COS-7 cells. For the long-standing debate on mitochondrial compartments pH, we measured the pH of mitochondrial cristae as 6.60 \pm 0.40, the pH of mitochondrial intermembrane space as 6.95 \pm 0.30, and two populations of mitochondrial matrix pH at approximately 7.20 \pm 0.27 and 7.50 \pm 0.16, respectively. Notably, the lysosome pH exhibited a single, narrow Gaussian distribution centered at 4.79 \pm 0.17. Furthermore, quantum chemistry computations revealed that both the deprotonation of the residue Y182 and the discrete curvature of deformed benzene ring in chromophore are both necessary for the quantum entanglement mechanism of SITE-pHorin. Intriguingly, our findings reveal an accurate pH gradient (0.6-0.9 pH unit) between mitochondrial cristae and matrix, suggesting prior knowledge about \Delta pH (0.4-0.6) and mitochondrial proton motive force (pmf) are underestimated.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Thermal Phase Fluctuations in Narrow Superfluid Rings**|Parth Sabharwal et.al.|[2407.04229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04229v1)|null|Using matter-wave interference, we have investigated thermal phase fluctuations in narrow coplanar, concentric rings of ultracold fermionic superfluids. We found that the correlation length decreases with number density, consistent with theoretical expectations. We also observed that increasing the coupling between the rings leads to greater overall coherence in the system. The phase fluctuations increased with a change from periodic to closed boundary conditions as we applied a potential barrier at one point in a ring. These results are relevant for the implementation of proposals to utilize ultracold quantum gases in large and elongated circuit-like geometries, especially those that require deterministic preparation and control of quantized circulation states.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Smart VisionLanguage Reasoners**|Denisa Roberts et.al.|[2407.04212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04212v1)|[link](https://github.com/smarter-vlm/smarter)|In this article, we investigate vision-language models (VLM) as reasoners. The ability to form abstractions underlies mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and other Math AI tasks. Several formalisms have been given to these underlying abstractions and skills utilized by humans and intelligent systems for reasoning. Furthermore, human reasoning is inherently multimodal, and as such, we focus our investigations on multimodal AI. In this article, we employ the abstractions given in the SMART task (Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task) introduced in \cite{cherian2022deep} as meta-reasoning and problem-solving skills along eight axes: math, counting, path, measure, logic, spatial, and pattern. We investigate the ability of vision-language models to reason along these axes and seek avenues of improvement. Including composite representations with vision-language cross-attention enabled learning multimodal representations adaptively from fused frozen pretrained backbones for better visual grounding. Furthermore, proper hyperparameter and other training choices led to strong improvements (up to $48\%$ gain in accuracy) on the SMART task, further underscoring the power of deep multimodal learning. The smartest VLM, which includes a novel QF multimodal layer, improves upon the best previous baselines in every one of the eight fundamental reasoning skills.

|**2024-07-04**|**Monomial web basis for the SLN skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere**|Tommaso Cremaschi et.al.|[2407.04178v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04178v1)|null|For any non-zero complex number $q$, excluding finitely many roots of unity of small order, a linear basis for the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere is constructed. In particular, the skein algebra is a commutative polynomial algebra in $n-1$ generators, where each generator is represented by an explicit $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ web, without crossings, on the surface. This includes the case $q=1$, where the skein algebra is identified with the coordinate ring of the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ character variety of the twice punctured sphere. The proof of both the spanning and linear independence properties of the basis depends on the so-called $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ quantum trace map, due originally to Bonahon-Wong in the case $n=2$. A consequence of the proof is that the polynomial algebra sits as a distinguished subalgebra of the L\^{e}-Sikora $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ stated skein algebra of the annulus. We end by discussing the relationship with Fock-Goncharov duality.|

Gefter et.al.|[2407.04122v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04122v1)|null|We study the copolynomials of $n$ variables, i.e. $K$-linear mappings from the ring of polynomials $K[x_1,...,x_n]$ into the commutative ring $K$.   We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for a linear differential equation of infinite order which can be considered as an algebraic version of the classical Malgrange-Ehrenpreis theorem for the existence of the fundamental solution of a linear differential operator with constant coefficients. We find the fundamental solutions of linear differential operators of infinite order and show that the unique solution of the corresponding inhomogeneous equation can be represented as a convolution of the fundamental solution of this operator and the right-hand side. We also prove the existence and uniqueness theorem of the Cauchy problem for some linear differential equations in the module of formal power series with copolynomial coefficients.|
|**2024-07-04**|**Properties of BesovLorentz spaces and application to NavierStokes equations**|Qixiang Yang et.al.|[2407.04107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04107v1)|null|Inspired by Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg, Fefferman and Lin, we try to investigate how to control the set of large value points for the strong solution of Navier-Stokes equations. Besov-Lorentz spaces have multiple indices which can reflect complex changes of the set of the large value points. Hence we consider some properties of Gauss flow, paraproduct flow and couple flow related to the Besov-Lorentz spaces. When dealing with Lorentz index, we use wavelets and maximum norm to describe the decay situation in the binary time ring and to define time-frequency microlocal maximum norm space. We use maximum operator, $\alpha$-triangle inequality and H\"older inequality etc to get accurate estimates. As an application, we get a global wellposedness result of the Navier-Stokes equations where the solution can reflect how the size of the set of large value points changes.|

|**2024-07-04**|**Cohomology and Ktheory of generalized Dold manifolds fibred by complex flag manifolds**|Manas Mandal et.al.|[2407.03932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03932v1)|null|Let $\nu=(n_1,\ldots, n_s), s\ge 2,$ be a sequence of positive integers and let $n=\sum_{1\le j\le s}n_j$. Let $\mathbb CG(\nu)=U(n)/(U(n_1)\times \cdots\times U(n_s))$ be the complex flag manifold. Denote by $P(m,\nu)=P(\mathbb S^m,\mathbb CG(\nu))$ the generalized Dold manifold $\mathbb S^m\times \mathbb CG(\nu)/\langle \theta\rangle $ where $\theta=\alpha\times \sigma$ with $\alpha:\mathbb S^m\to \mathbb S^m$ being the antipodal map and $\sigma:\mathbb CG(\nu)\to \mathbb CG(\nu)$, the complex conjugation. The manifold $P(m,\nu)$ has the structure of a smooth $\mathbb CG(\nu)$-bundle over the real projective space $\mathbb RP^m.$ We determine the additive structure of $H^*(P(m,\nu);R)$ when $R=\mathbb Z$ and its ring structure when $R$ is a commutative ring in which $2$ is invertible. As an application, we determine the additive structure of $K(P(m,\nu))$ almost completely and also obtain partial results on its ring structure. The results for the singular homology are obtained for generalized Dold spaces $P(S,X)=S\times X/\langle \theta\rangle$, where $\theta=\alpha\times \sigma$, $\alpha:S\to S$ is a fixed point free involution and $\sigma:X\to X$ is an involution with $\mathrm{Fix}(\sigma)\ne \emptyset,$ for a much wider class of spaces $S$ and $X$.|
|**2024-07-04**|**Observation of exceptional line semimetal in threedimensional nonHermitian phononic crystals**|Yejian Hu et.al.|[2407.03868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03868v1)|null|Non-Hermitian topological phases, which exhibit unique features such as skin effect and exceptional points originated from nontrivial band topologies in complex plane, have attracted enormous attention in condensed-matter physics and metamaterials. Here we report the realization of an exceptional line semimetal in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian phononic crystal. A pair of exceptional rings with opposite topologies are connected by the drumhead bulk states in the first Brillouin zone. The exceptional rings not only possess wave-function topology and thus result in the drumhead surface states, but also host spectral topology and thereby give rise to the hybrid-order geometry-dependent skin effect in three dimensions. Our experimental results evidence the complete non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence of the three-dimensional exceptional line semimetal, and may pave the way for designing non-Hermitian acoustic devices.|
|**2024-07-04**|**Weighted basic parallel processes and combinatorial enumeration**|Lorenzo Clemente et.al.|[2407.03638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03638v1)|null|We study weighted basic parallel processes (WBPP), a nonlinear recursive generalisation of weighted finite automata inspired from process algebra and Petri net theory. Our main result is an algorithm of 2-EXPSPACE complexity for the WBPP equivalence problem. While (unweighted) BPP language equivalence is undecidable, we can use this algorithm to decide multiplicity equivalence of BPP and language equivalence of unambiguous BPP, with the same complexity. These are long-standing open problems for the related model of weighted context-free grammars. Our second contribution is a connection between WBPP, power series solutions of systems of polynomial differential equations, and combinatorial enumeration. To this end we consider constructible differentially finite power series (CDF), a class of multivariate differentially algebraic series introduced by Bergeron and Reutenauer in order to provide a combinatorial interpretation to differential equations. CDF series generalise rational, algebraic, and a large class of D-finite (holonomic) series, for which decidability of equivalence was an open problem. We show that CDF series correspond to commutative WBPP series. As a consequence of our result on WBPP and commutativity, we show that equivalence of CDF power series can be decided with 2-EXPTIME complexity. The complexity analysis is based on effective bounds from algebraic geometry, namely on the length of chains of polynomial ideals constructed by repeated application of finitely many, not necessarily commuting derivations of a multivariate polynomial ring. This is obtained by generalising a result of Novikov and Yakovenko in the case of a single derivation, which is noteworthy since generic bounds on ideal chains are non-primitive recursive in general. On the way, we develop the theory of \WBPP~series and \CDF~power series, exposing several of their appealing properties.|
|**2024-07-04**|**On Finite Fields and Higher Reciprocity**|Matias Relyea et.al.|[2407.03559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03559v1)|null|Cubic and biquadratic reciprocity have long since been referred to as "the forgotten reciprocity laws", largely since they provide special conditions that are widely considered to be unnecessary in the study of number theory. In this exposition of finite fields and higher reciprocity, we will begin by introducing concepts in abstract algebra and elementary number theory. This will motivate our approach toward understanding the structure and then existence of finite fields, especially with a focus on understanding the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}^{*}$. While surveying finite fields we will provide another proof of quadratic reciprocity. We will proceed to investigate properties of the general multiplicative character, covering the concept of a general Gauss sum as well as basic notions of the Jacobi sum. From there we will begin laying the foundations for the cubic reciprocity law, beginning with a classification of the primes and units of the Eisenstein integers, denoted $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$, and further investigations into the residue class ring $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]/\pi\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ for $\pi$ prime, which is predominantly the world in which cubic reciprocity lies. We then define the general multiplicative character and state the full law of cubic reciprocity. We will finish the section on cubic reciprocity with a brief survey of the cubic residue character of the even prime $2$ and state a significant result due to Gauss that summarizes the conditions for $2$ to be a cubic residue. We conclude with a brief survey of the law of biquadratic reciprocity.|

We show that the system possesses two types of HOTPs. The first type, analogous to Floquet topology, generates a total of $8$ corner modes at $0$ or $\pi$ eigenphase, while the second type, hidden behind a weak topological phase, yields a unique phase with $8$ corner modes at $\pm\pi/2$ eigenphase (after gapping out the counterpropagating edge states), arising from the product of particle-hole and phase rotation symmetry. By using a bulk $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological index ($Q$), we found both HOTPs have $Q=2$, whereas $Q=0$ for the trivial and the conventional weak topological phase. Together with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index associated with the reflection matrix, we are able to fully distinguish all phases. Our work motivates further studies on magnetic topological phases and symmetry protected $2\pi/n$ boundary modes, as well as suggests that such phases may find their experimental realization in coupled-ring-resonator networks.|

Lozano-Negro et.al.|[2407.03273v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03273v1)|null|Out-of-Time-Order Correlators (OTOCs) serve as a proxy for quantum information scrambling, which refers to the process where information stored locally disperses across the many-body degrees of freedom in a quantum system, rendering it inaccessible to local probes. Most experimental implementations of OTOCs to probe information scrambling rely on indirect measurements based on global observables, using techniques such as Loschmidt echoes and Multiple Quantum Coherences, via time reversal evolutions. In this article, we establish a direct connection between OTOCs with global and local observables in the context of NMR experiments, where the observable is the total magnetization of the system. We conduct a numerical analysis to quantify the differences in the evolution of both magnitudes, evaluating the excitation dynamics in spin ring systems with 8 to 16 spins, using a many-body Hamiltonian and long-range interactions. Our analysis decomposes the global echo into a sum of local echoes and cross-contributions, leading to local and global OTOCs. The results indicate that, after an initial transient period, local OTOCs determine the global ones. To confirm the equivalence, we observe that the difference between local and global OTOCs, as well as their fluctuations, becomes negligible as the system size increases. This behavior aligns with that observed in highly interacting or chaotic systems in several experiments.|

It provides interactive services for managing billing and electricity consumption, but it also introduces new vectors for cyberattacks. Although, the devastating and severe impact of power overloading cyberattacks on smart grid AMI, few researches in the literature have addressed them. In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker's strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.|

The purpose of this work is to study when $\overline{\Gamma}(R\Join I)$ and $\Gamma(R\Join I)$ coincide, to characterize when $\overline{\Gamma}(R\Join I)$ is complete, and to compute the diameter and the girth of $\overline{\Gamma}(R\Join I)$.|

Two vertices $\hat{I}$ and $\hat{J}$ are adjacent if and only if $\hat{I}+ \hat{J}$ is an essential ideal. In this paper, we characterize the graph $\mathcal{E}_{R}$ as having a finite metric dimension.   Additionally, we identify that the essential ideal graph and annihilating ideal graph of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ are isomorphic whenever $n$ is a product of distinct primes. Also, we estimate the metric dimension of the essential ideal graph of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Furthermore, we determine the topological indices, namely the first and the second Zagreb indices, of $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbb Z_n}$.|

The branching fractions of the two decays $J/\psi \to p \bar{p} \eta(\eta \to \gamma\gamma)$ and $J/\psi \to p \bar{p} \eta(\eta \to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0)$ are measured individually to be $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi \to p \bar{p} \eta(\eta \to \gamma\gamma)) = (1.480 \pm 0.001 \pm 0.024)\times\,10^{-3}$ and $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi \to p \bar{p} \eta(\eta \to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0)) = (1.557 \pm 0.003 \pm 0.038)\times\,10^{-3}$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. Both results are compatible within their uncorrelated systematic uncertainties. The combined result is $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi \to p \bar{p} \eta)=(1.495 \pm 0.001 \pm 0.023)\times\,10^{-3}$ where the first uncertainty is the combined statistical uncertainty and the second one the combined systematic uncertainty of both analyses, incorporating correlations between them. In addition, the $p \bar{p}$ threshold region is investigated for a potential threshold enhancement, and no evidence for one is observed.|

Winkler et.al.|[2407.02860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02860v1)|null|We theoretically study the conformational and dynamical properties of semiflexible active polar ring polymers under linear shear flow. A ring is described as a continuous Gaussian polymer with a tangential active force of a constant density along its contour. The linear but non-Hermitian equation of motion is solved using an eigenfunction expansion, which yields activity-independent, but shear-rate-dependent, relaxation times and activity-dependent frequencies. As a consequence, the ring's stationary-state properties are independent of activity, and its conformations as well as rheological properties are equal to those of a passive ring under shear. The presence of characteristic time scales by the relaxation and the frequency gives rise to a particular dynamical behavior. A tank-treading-like motion emerges for large relaxation times and high frequencies, specifically for stiffer rings, governed by the activity-dependent frequencies. In the case of very flexible polymers, the relaxation behavior dominates over tank-treading. Shear strongly affects the crossover from a tank-treading to a relaxation-time dominated dynamics and suppresses tank-treading. This is reflected in the tumbling frequency, which exhibits two shear-rate dependent regimes, with an activity-dependent plateau at low shear rates followed by a power-law regime with increasing tumbling frequency for large shear rates.|
