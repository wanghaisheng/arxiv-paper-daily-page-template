The sim2real approach faces challenges due to mismatches between simulation and reality. These discrepancies arise from inaccuracies in modeling physical phenomena and asynchronous control, among other factors. To this end, we introduce EAGERx, a framework with a unified software pipeline for both real and simulated robot learning. It can support various simulators and aids in integrating state, action and time-scale abstractions to facilitate learning. EAGERx's integrated delay simulation, domain randomization features, and proposed synchronization algorithm contribute to narrowing the sim2real gap. We demonstrate (in the context of robot learning and beyond) the efficacy of EAGERx in accommodating diverse robotic systems and maintaining consistent simulation behavior. EAGERx is open source and its code is available at https://eagerx.readthedocs.io.|

The results show that despite radial bar charts are the most popular visualization for activity data on smartwatches, the users' preferences might be influenced by their familiarity with these charts. These findings from this survey will be valuable for designers, developers, and researchers who are interested in creating innovative and effective solutions for activity visualization on smartwatches.|

We view the effectiveness of Borel summation as a regularity property of the solution, and we show that the solutions of certain differential equation and integration problems are regular in this sense. By taking a geometric perspective on the Laplace and Borel transforms, we also clarify why "Borel regular" solutions are associated with special points on the Borel plane. The particular classes of problems we look at are level 1 ODEs and exponential period integrals over one dimensional Lefschetz thimbles. To expand the variety of examples available in the literature, we treat various examples of these problems in detail.|

The GAVRT Solar Patrol project uses a 34 m diameter antenna to produce raster-scan maps of the Sun simultaneously at 4 frequencies ranging from approximately 3 GHz to 14 GHz. On 2024 May 14, as part of regular GAVRT Solar Patrol observations, raster maps were produced when an X8.7 solar flare occurred in active region AR13664. Here we present the GAVRT maps of the May 14 flare along with microwave flux density spectra showing the non-thermal microwave burst emission from mildly relativistic electrons produced in this largest flare of Solar Cycle 25 to date. AR13664 reappeared as AR13697 and continued to be very active, producing X flares while GAVRT monitored its activity. GAVRT microwave data provide a powerful complement to the energetic electrons tracked by X-ray, millimeter-wave and {\gamma}-ray emissions.|

To emulate these in aerial robots weighing less than a gram, known as flying insect robots (FIRs), a fast and responsive control system is essential. To date, these have largely been, at their core, elaborations of proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type feedback control. Without exception, their gains have been painstakingly tuned by hand. Aggressive maneuvers have further required task-specific tuning. Optimal control has the potential to mitigate these issues, but has to date only been demonstrated using approxiate models and receding horizon controllers (RHC) that are too computationally demanding to be carried out onboard the robot. Here we used a more accurate stroke-averaged model of forces and torques to implement the first demonstration of optimal control on an FIR that is computationally efficient enough to be performed by a microprocessor carried onboard. We took force and torque measurements from a 150 mg FIR, the UW Robofly, using a custom-built sensitive force-torque sensor, and validated them using motion capture data in free flight. We demonstrated stable hovering (RMS error of about 4 cm) and trajectory tracking maneuvers at translational velocities up to 25 cm/s using an optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR). These results were enabled by a more accurate model and lay the foundation for future work that uses our improved model and optimal controller in conjunction with recent advances in low-power receding horizon control to perform accurate aggressive maneuvers without iterative, task-specific tuning.|

Unlike commercial health apps for wearables, our system offers a comprehensive statistical analysis component that discovers correlations and trends in user data, allowing users to ask questions in natural language and receive generated personalized insights, and guides them to develop actionable goals. As a case study, we focus on improving sleep quality, given its measurability through physiological data and its importance to general well-being. Through a user study with 24 Fitbit watch users, we demonstrate that PhysioLLM outperforms both the Fitbit App alone and a generic LLM chatbot in facilitating a deeper, personalized understanding of health data and supporting actionable steps toward personal health goals.|

However, there is a lack of research focused on predicting and developing application systems using clinical notes and blood test values. We collected five years of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from Taiwan's hospital database between 2017 and 2021 as an AI database. Furthermore, we developed an EHR-based chronic disease prediction platform utilizing Large Language Multimodal Models (LLMMs), successfully integrating with frontend web and mobile applications for prediction. This prediction platform can also connect to the hospital's backend database, providing physicians with real-time risk assessment diagnostics. The demonstration link can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmL9DEDFgA.|

However, previous attempts still struggle with stochastic inference, conflicting with the deterministic nature of the Image2Normal task, and costly ensembling step, which slows down the estimation process. Our method, StableNormal, mitigates the stochasticity of the diffusion process by reducing inference variance, thus producing "Stable-and-Sharp" normal estimates without any additional ensembling process. StableNormal works robustly under challenging imaging conditions, such as extreme lighting, blurring, and low quality. It is also robust against transparent and reflective surfaces, as well as cluttered scenes with numerous objects. Specifically, StableNormal employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, which starts with a one-step normal estimator (YOSO) to derive an initial normal guess, that is relatively coarse but reliable, then followed by a semantic-guided refinement process (SG-DRN) that refines the normals to recover geometric details. The effectiveness of StableNormal is demonstrated through competitive performance in standard datasets such as DIODE-indoor, iBims, ScannetV2 and NYUv2, and also in various downstream tasks, such as surface reconstruction and normal enhancement. These results evidence that StableNormal retains both the "stability" and "sharpness" for accurate normal estimation. StableNormal represents a baby attempt to repurpose diffusion priors for deterministic estimation. To democratize this, code and models have been publicly available in hf.co/Stable-X|

Unfortunately, many children and youth from low-income families are unable to engage in this sport mainly due to financial constraints such as private lesson expenses as well as logistical concerns to and back from such lessons and clinics. While several tennis self-training systems exist, they are often tailored for professionals and are prohibitively expensive. The present study aims to classify tennis players' skill levels and classify tennis strokes into phases characterized by motion attributes for a future development of an AI-based tennis self-training model for affordable and convenient applications running on devices used in daily life such as an iPhone or an Apple Watch for tennis skill improvement. We collected motion data, including Motion Yaw, Roll and Pitch from inertial measurement units (IMUs) worn by participating junior tennis players. For this pilot study, data from twelve participants were processed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The SVM models demonstrated an overall accuracy of 77% in classifying players as beginners or intermediates, with low rates of false positives and false negatives, effectively distinguishing skill levels. Additionally, the tennis swings were successfully classified into five phases based on the collected motion data. These findings indicate that SVM-based classification can be a reliable foundation for developing an equitable and accessible AI-driven tennis training system.|

Chien et.al.|[2406.14888v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14888v1)|null|The nature of the interaction between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their host galaxies remains an unsolved question. Therefore, conducting an AGN census is valuable to AGN research. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of AGNs are obscured by their environment, which blocks UV and optical emissions due to the dusty torus surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). To overcome this challenge, mid-infrared (IR) surveys have emerged as a valuable tool for identifying obscured AGNs, as the obscured light is re-emitted in this range. With its high sensitivity, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) uncovered more fainter objects than previous telescopes. By applying the SED fitting, this work investigates AGN candidates in JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) fields. We identified 42 candidates, 30 of them are classified as composites ($0.2\leq f_{\rm AGN, IR}< 0.5$), and 12 of them are AGNs ($f_{\rm AGN, IR}\geq 0.5$). We report the AGN luminosity contributions and AGN number fractions as a function of redshift and total infrared luminosity, showing that previously reported increasing relations are not apparent in our sample due to the sample size. We also extend the previous results on ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, $L_{\rm TIR}\geq 10^{12} L_{\odot}$) to less luminous AGNs, highlighting the power of JWST.|
|**2024-06-20**|**Revealing VisionLanguage Integration in the Brain with Multimodal Networks**|Vighnesh Subramaniam et.al.|[2406.14481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14481v1)|null|We use (multi)modal deep neural networks (DNNs) to probe for sites of multimodal integration in the human brain by predicting stereoencephalography (SEEG) recordings taken while human subjects watched movies. We operationalize sites of multimodal integration as regions where a multimodal vision-language model predicts recordings better than unimodal language, unimodal vision, or linearly-integrated language-vision models. Our target DNN models span different architectures (e.g., convolutional networks and transformers) and multimodal training techniques (e.g., cross-attention and contrastive learning). As a key enabling step, we first demonstrate that trained vision and language models systematically outperform their randomly initialized counterparts in their ability to predict SEEG signals. We then compare unimodal and multimodal models against one another. Because our target DNN models often have different architectures, number of parameters, and training sets (possibly obscuring those differences attributable to integration), we carry out a controlled comparison of two models (SLIP and SimCLR), which keep all of these attributes the same aside from input modality. Using this approach, we identify a sizable number of neural sites (on average 141 out of 1090 total sites or 12.94%) and brain regions where multimodal integration seems to occur. Additionally, we find that among the variants of multimodal training techniques we assess, CLIP-style training is the best suited for downstream prediction of the neural activity in these sites.|

In the absence of clear legal definitions and a lack of transparency regarding the role of algorithms in shaping decisions on content moderation, there is a critical need for external accountability. Our study contributes to filling this gap by systematically evaluating four leading cloud-based content moderation services through a third-party audit, highlighting issues such as biases against minorities and vulnerable groups that may arise through over-reliance on these services. Using a black-box audit approach and four benchmark data sets, we measure performance in explicit and implicit hate speech detection as well as counterfactual fairness through perturbation sensitivity analysis and present disparities in performance for certain target identity groups and data sets. Our analysis reveals that all services had difficulties detecting implicit hate speech, which relies on more subtle and codified messages. Moreover, our results point to the need to remove group-specific bias. It seems that biases towards some groups, such as Women, have been mostly rectified, while biases towards other groups, such as LGBTQ+ and PoC remain.|
|**2024-06-20**|**Towards Eventoriented Long Video Understanding**|Yifan Du et.al.|[2406.14129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14129v1)|[link](https://github.com/rucaibox/event-bench)|With the rapid development of video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous benchmarks have been proposed to assess their video understanding capability. However, due to the lack of rich events in the videos, these datasets may suffer from the short-cut bias that the answers can be deduced from a few frames, without the need to watch the entire video. To address this issue, we introduce Event-Bench, an event-oriented long video understanding benchmark built on existing datasets and human annotations. Event-Bench includes six event-related tasks and 2,190 test instances to comprehensively evaluate video event understanding ability. Additionally, we propose Video Instruction Merging~(VIM), a cost-effective method that enhances video MLLMs using merged, event-intensive video instructions, addressing the scarcity of human-annotated, event-intensive data. Extensive experiments show that the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 53.33, significantly outperforming the best open-source model by 41.42%. Leveraging an effective instruction synthesis method and an adaptive model architecture, VIM surpasses both state-of-the-art open-source models and GPT-4V on the Event-Bench. All code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Event-Bench.|

To address this challenge, we propose APPL, A Prompt Programming Language that acts as a bridge between computer programs and LLMs, allowing seamless embedding of prompts into Python functions, and vice versa. APPL provides an intuitive and Python-native syntax, an efficient parallelized runtime with asynchronous semantics, and a tracing module supporting effective failure diagnosis and replaying without extra costs. We demonstrate that APPL programs are intuitive, concise, and efficient through three representative scenarios: Chain-of-Thought with self-consistency (CoT-SC), ReAct tool use agent, and multi-agent chat. Experiments on three parallelizable workflows further show that APPL can effectively parallelize independent LLM calls, with a significant speedup ratio that almost matches the estimation.|

However, it remains unclear how (or whether) these ads affect users' perceptions and knowledge about VPNs. In this work, we explore the relationship between YouTube VPN ad exposure and users' mental models of VPNs, security, and privacy. We use a novel VPN ad detection model to calculate the ad exposure of 217 participants via their YouTube watch histories, and we develop scales to characterize their mental models in relation to claims commonly made in VPN ads. Through (pre-registered) regression-based analysis, we find that exposure to VPN ads is significantly correlated with familiarity with VPN brands and increased belief in (hyperbolic) threats. While not specific to VPNs, these threats are often discussed in VPN ads. In contrast, although many participants agree with both factual and misleading mental models of VPNs that often appear in ads, we find no significant correlation between exposure to VPN ads and these mental models. These findings suggest that, if VPN ads do impact mental models, then it is predominantly emotional (i.e., threat perceptions) rather than technical.|

However, the resources currently available to the public are limited and fail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between drugs and their side effects. This paper introduces DrugWatch, an easy-to-use and interactive multi-source information visualisation platform for drug safety study. It allows users to understand common side effects of drugs and their statistical information, flexibly retrieve relevant medical reports, or annotate their own medical texts with our automated annotation tool. Supported by NLP technology and enriched with interactive visual components, we are committed to providing researchers and practitioners with a one-stop information analysis, retrieval, and annotation service.

Recent approaches have utilized tuning with expert trajectories to enhance agent performance, yet they primarily concentrate on outcome rewards, which may lead to errors or suboptimal actions due to the absence of process supervision signals. In this paper, we introduce the Iterative step-level Process Refinement (IPR) framework, which provides detailed step-by-step guidance to enhance agent training. Specifically, we adopt the Monte Carlo method to estimate step-level rewards. During each iteration, the agent explores along the expert trajectory and generates new actions. These actions are then evaluated against the corresponding step of expert trajectory using step-level rewards. Such comparison helps identify discrepancies, yielding contrastive action pairs that serve as training data for the agent. Our experiments on three complex agent tasks demonstrate that our framework outperforms a variety of strong baselines. Moreover, our analytical findings highlight the effectiveness of IPR in augmenting action efficiency and its applicability to diverse models.|

However, the security risks of these practices themselves remain largely unexplored, which is highly concerning. To bridge this gap, this work investigates the vulnerabilities of security-enhancing diffusion models. Specifically, we demonstrate that these models are highly susceptible to DIFF2, a simple yet effective backdoor attack, which substantially diminishes the security assurance provided by such models. Essentially, DIFF2 achieves this by integrating a malicious diffusion-sampling process into the diffusion model, guiding inputs embedded with specific triggers toward an adversary-defined distribution while preserving the normal functionality for clean inputs. Our case studies on adversarial purification and robustness certification show that DIFF2 can significantly reduce both post-purification and certified accuracy across benchmark datasets and models, highlighting the potential risks of relying on pre-trained diffusion models as defensive tools. We further explore possible countermeasures, suggesting promising avenues for future research.|

Organisms in Coralai utilize modular, GPU-accelerated Taichi kernels to interact, enact environmental changes, and evolve through local survival, merging, and mutation operations implemented with HyperNEAT and PyTorch. We provide an exploratory experiment implementing physics inspired by slime mold behavior showcasing the emergence of competition between sessile and mobile organisms, cycles of resource depletion and recovery, and symbiosis between diverse organisms. We conclude by outlining future work to discover simulation parameters through measures of multi-scale complexity and diversity.

A core requirement is an efficient architecture that scales well to large-scale datasets and large image resolutions. Unfortunately, existing 3D GANs struggle to scale to generate samples at high resolutions due to their relatively slow train and render speeds, and typically have to rely on 2D superresolution networks at the expense of global 3D consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Generative Gaussian Heads (GGHead), which adopts the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation within a 3D GAN framework. To generate a 3D representation, we employ a powerful 2D CNN generator to predict Gaussian attributes in the UV space of a template head mesh. This way, GGHead exploits the regularity of the template's UV layout, substantially facilitating the challenging task of predicting an unstructured set of 3D Gaussians. We further improve the geometric fidelity of the generated 3D representations with a novel total variation loss on rendered UV coordinates. Intuitively, this regularization encourages that neighboring rendered pixels should stem from neighboring Gaussians in the template's UV space. Taken together, our pipeline can efficiently generate 3D heads trained only from single-view 2D image observations. Our proposed framework matches the quality of existing 3D head GANs on FFHQ while being both substantially faster and fully 3D consistent. As a result, we demonstrate real-time generation and rendering of high-quality 3D-consistent heads at $1024^2$ resolution for the first time.|

The task can be decomposed into two sub-problems: (1) speech-driven lip motion generation and (2) visual appearance synthesis. Current solutions handle the two sub-problems within a single generative model, resulting in a challenging trade-off between lip-sync quality and visual details preservation. Instead, we propose to disentangle the motion and appearance, and then generate them one by one with a speech-to-motion diffusion model and a motion-conditioned appearance generation model. However, there still remain challenges in each stage, such as motion-aware identity preservation in (1) and visual details preservation in (2). Therefore, to preserve personal identity, we adopt landmarks to represent the motion, and further employ a landmark-based identity loss. To capture motion-agnostic visual details, we use separate encoders to encode the lip, non-lip appearance and motion, and then integrate them with a learned fusion module. We train MyTalk on a large-scale and diverse dataset. Experiments show that our method generalizes well to the unknown, even out-of-domain person, in terms of both lip sync and visual detail preservation. We encourage the readers to watch the videos on our project page (https://Ingrid789.github.io/MyTalk/).|

However, watch time prediction suffers from duration bias, hindering its ability to reflect users' interests accurately. Existing label-correction approaches attempt to uncover user interests through grouping and normalizing observed watch time according to video duration. Although effective to some extent, we found that these approaches regard completely played records (i.e., a user watches the entire video) as equally high interest, which deviates from what we observed on real datasets: users have varied explicit feedback proportion when completely playing videos. In this paper, we introduce the counterfactual watch time(CWT), the potential watch time a user would spend on the video if its duration is sufficiently long. Analysis shows that the duration bias is caused by the truncation of CWT due to the video duration limitation, which usually occurs on those completely played records. Besides, a Counterfactual Watch Model (CWM) is proposed, revealing that CWT equals the time users get the maximum benefit from video recommender systems. Moreover, a cost-based transform function is defined to transform the CWT into the estimation of user interest, and the model can be learned by optimizing a counterfactual likelihood function defined over observed user watch times. Extensive experiments on three real video recommendation datasets and online A/B testing demonstrated that CWM effectively enhanced video recommendation accuracy and counteracted the duration bias.|

Yet, analyzing vast, unlabeled video data, often spanning hours, remains a challenge for machine learning, especially in computer vision. Existing approaches often analyze only a few frames. Our focus is on long-term animal behavior analysis. To address this challenge, we utilize classical probabilistic methods for state estimation, such as particle filtering. By incorporating recent advancements in semantic object segmentation, we enable continuous tracking of rapidly evolving object formations, even in scenarios with limited data availability. Particle filters offer a provably optimal algorithmic structure for recursively adding new incoming information. We propose a novel approach for tracking schools of fish in the open ocean from drone videos. Our framework not only performs classical object tracking in 2D, instead it tracks the position and spatial expansion of the fish school in world coordinates by fusing video data and the drone's on board sensor information (GPS and IMU). The presented framework for the first time allows researchers to study collective behavior of fish schools in its natural social and environmental context in a non-invasive and scalable way.|

Being able to proactively reach users, the system has to decide when to send notifications to users. Although many researchers have studied optimizing the timing of sending notifications, they only utilized users' contextual features, without modeling users' behavior patterns. Additionally, these efforts only focus on individual notifications, and there is a lack of studies on optimizing the holistic timing of multiple notifications within a period. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Temporal Interaction Model (TIM), which models users' behavior patterns by estimating CTR in every time slot over a day in our short video application Kuaishou. TIM leverages long-term user historical interaction sequence features such as notification receipts, clicks, watch time and effective views, and employs a temporal attention unit (TAU) to extract user behavior patterns. Moreover, we provide an elegant strategy of holistic notifications send time control to improve user engagement while minimizing disruption. We evaluate the effectiveness of TIM through offline experiments and online A/B tests. The results indicate that TIM is a reliable tool for forecasting user behavior, leading to a remarkable enhancement in user engagement without causing undue disturbance.|

Existing diffusion-based motion editing methods overlook the profound potential of the prior embedded within the weights of pre-trained models, which enables manipulating the latent feature space; hence, they primarily center on handling the motion space. In this work, we explore the attention mechanism of pre-trained motion diffusion models. We uncover the roles and interactions of attention elements in capturing and representing intricate human motion patterns, and carefully integrate these elements to transfer a leader motion to a follower one while maintaining the nuanced characteristics of the follower, resulting in zero-shot motion transfer. Editing features associated with selected motions allows us to confront a challenge observed in prior motion diffusion approaches, which use general directives (e.g., text, music) for editing, ultimately failing to convey subtle nuances effectively. Our work is inspired by how a monkey closely imitates what it sees while maintaining its unique motion patterns; hence we call it Monkey See, Monkey Do, and dub it MoMo. Employing our technique enables accomplishing tasks such as synthesizing out-of-distribution motions, style transfer, and spatial editing. Furthermore, diffusion inversion is seldom employed for motions; as a result, editing efforts focus on generated motions, limiting the editability of real ones. MoMo harnesses motion inversion, extending its application to both real and generated motions. Experimental results show the advantage of our approach over the current art. In particular, unlike methods tailored for specific applications through training, our approach is applied at inference time, requiring no training.

Despite this growing interest, the development of stable and efficient agent systems poses substantial practical challenges. In this paper, we introduce FinVerse, a meticulously crafted agent system designed for a broad range of financial topics. FinVerse integrates over 600 financial APIs, enabling access to more accurate and extensive financial information compared to generalist agents. To enhance financial information processing capabilities, FinVerse is equipped with an embedded code interpreter, enabling the execution of complex data analysis tasks with precision and efficiency. Our work includes an empirical comparison of several LLMs in driving FinVerse. Specifically, we propose our own scheme for training LLMs using SFT to optimize LLM performance within FinVerse. Recognizing the scarcity of specialized datasets to build LLMs for agents, we have constructed a dataset and plan to make it open-source, providing a valuable resource for peer application developers.

We show that DenseAV can discover the ``meaning'' of words and the ``location'' of sounds without explicit localization supervision. Furthermore, it automatically discovers and distinguishes between these two types of associations without supervision. We show that DenseAV's localization abilities arise from a new multi-head feature aggregation operator that directly compares dense image and audio representations for contrastive learning. In contrast, many other systems that learn ``global'' audio and video representations cannot localize words and sound. Finally, we contribute two new datasets to improve the evaluation of AV representations through speech and sound prompted semantic segmentation. On these and other datasets we show DenseAV dramatically outperforms the prior art on speech and sound prompted semantic segmentation. DenseAV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, ImageBind, on cross-modal retrieval using fewer than half of the parameters. Project Page: \href{https://aka.ms/denseav}{https://aka.ms/denseav}|

Designing such a robotic system is a complex problem which presents several open challenges. To bypass these challenges, the current generation of assembly systems is built with a lot of system integration effort to provide the structure and precision necessary for assembly. These systems are mostly responsible for part singulation, part kitting, and part detection, which is accomplished by intelligent system design. In this paper, we present autonomous assembly of a gear box with minimum requirements on structure. The assembly parts are randomly placed in a two-dimensional work environment for the robot. The proposed system makes use of several different manipulation skills such as sliding for grasping, in-hand manipulation, and insertion to assemble the gear box. All these tasks are run in a closed-loop fashion using vision, tactile, and Force-Torque (F/T) sensors. We perform extensive hardware experiments to show the robustness of the proposed methods as well as the overall system. See supplementary video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ9M1DQ23OI.|

It is unclear what role technology plays for those with experience at this task. In search of opportunities for the development of novel human-recording interactions, we analyze 18 YouTube videos depicting real-world examples of by-ear learning, and discuss why, during this preliminary phase of research, online videos are appropriate data. From our observations we generate hypotheses that can inform future work. For example, a musician's scope of learning may influence what technological interactions would help them, they could benefit from tools that accommodate their working memory, and transcription does not appear to play a key role in ear learning. Based on these findings, we pose a number of research questions, and discuss their methodological considerations to guide future study.|
