Unlike Centralized FL, Decentralized FL (DFL) employs a network architecture that eliminates the need for a central server, allowing direct communication among clients and leading to significant communication resource savings. However, due to data heterogeneity, not all neighboring nodes contribute to enhancing the local client's model performance. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\emph{AFIND+}}, a simple yet efficient algorithm for sampling and aggregating neighbors in DFL, with the aim of leveraging collaboration to improve clients' model performance. AFIND+ identifies helpful neighbors, adaptively adjusts the number of selected neighbors, and strategically aggregates the sampled neighbors' models based on their contributions. Numerical results on real-world datasets with diverse data partitions demonstrate that AFIND+ outperforms other sampling algorithms in DFL and is compatible with most existing DFL optimization algorithms.|

The sim2real approach faces challenges due to mismatches between simulation and reality. These discrepancies arise from inaccuracies in modeling physical phenomena and asynchronous control, among other factors. To this end, we introduce EAGERx, a framework with a unified software pipeline for both real and simulated robot learning. It can support various simulators and aids in integrating state, action and time-scale abstractions to facilitate learning. EAGERx's integrated delay simulation, domain randomization features, and proposed synchronization algorithm contribute to narrowing the sim2real gap. We demonstrate (in the context of robot learning and beyond) the efficacy of EAGERx in accommodating diverse robotic systems and maintaining consistent simulation behavior. EAGERx is open source and its code is available at https://eagerx.readthedocs.io.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Effective Targeted Testing of Smart Contracts**|Mahdi Fooladgar et.al.|[2407.04250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04250v1)|null|Smart contracts are autonomous and immutable pieces of code that are deployed on blockchain networks and run by miners. They were first introduced by Ethereum in 2014 and have since been used for various applications such as security tokens, voting, gambling, non-fungible tokens, self-sovereign identities, stock taking, decentralized finances, decentralized exchanges, and atomic swaps. Since smart contracts are immutable, their bugs cannot be fixed, which may lead to significant monetary losses. While many researchers have focused on testing smart contracts, our recent work has highlighted a gap between test adequacy and test data generation, despite numerous efforts in both fields. Our framework, Griffin, tackles this deficiency by employing a targeted symbolic execution technique for generating test data. This tool can be used in diverse applications, such as killing the survived mutants in mutation testing, validating static analysis alarms, creating counter-examples for safety conditions, and reaching manually selected lines of code. This paper discusses how smart contracts differ from legacy software in targeted symbolic execution and how these differences can affect the tool structure, leading us to propose an enhanced version of the control-flow graph for Solidity smart contracts called CFG+. We also discuss how Griffin can utilize custom heuristics to explore the program space and find the test data that reaches a target line while considering a safety condition in a reasonable execution time. We conducted experiments involving an extensive set of smart contracts, target lines, and safety conditions based on real-world faults and test suites from related tools. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that Griffin can effectively identify the required test data within a reasonable timeframe.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Smart VisionLanguage Reasoners**|Denisa Roberts et.al.|[2407.04212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04212v1)|[link](https://github.com/smarter-vlm/smarter)|In this article, we investigate vision-language models (VLM) as reasoners. The ability to form abstractions underlies mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and other Math AI tasks. Several formalisms have been given to these underlying abstractions and skills utilized by humans and intelligent systems for reasoning. Furthermore, human reasoning is inherently multimodal, and as such, we focus our investigations on multimodal AI. In this article, we employ the abstractions given in the SMART task (Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task) introduced in \cite{cherian2022deep} as meta-reasoning and problem-solving skills along eight axes: math, counting, path, measure, logic, spatial, and pattern. We investigate the ability of vision-language models to reason along these axes and seek avenues of improvement. Including composite representations with vision-language cross-attention enabled learning multimodal representations adaptively from fused frozen pretrained backbones for better visual grounding. Furthermore, proper hyperparameter and other training choices led to strong improvements (up to $48\%$ gain in accuracy) on the SMART task, further underscoring the power of deep multimodal learning. The smartest VLM, which includes a novel QF multimodal layer, improves upon the best previous baselines in every one of the eight fundamental reasoning skills.

It provides interactive services for managing billing and electricity consumption, but it also introduces new vectors for cyberattacks. Although, the devastating and severe impact of power overloading cyberattacks on smart grid AMI, few researches in the literature have addressed them. In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker's strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.|

For this security paradigm to be fully realized, it necessitates the active participation of small-scale power suppliers (SPSs) in implementing honeypots and engaging in collaborative data sharing with traditional power retailers (TPRs). To motivate this interaction, TPRs incentivize data sharing with tangible rewards. However, without access to an SPS's confidential data, it is daunting for TPRs to validate shared data, thereby risking SPSs' privacy and increasing sharing costs due to voluminous honeypot logs. These challenges can be resolved by utilizing Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that allows for model training without data relocation. However, the conventional FL algorithm lacks the requisite functionality for both the security defense model and the rewards system of the AMI network. This work presents two solutions: first, an enhanced and cost-efficient FedAvg algorithm incorporating a novel data quality measure, and second, FedPot, the development of an effective security model with a fair incentives mechanism under an FL architecture. Accordingly, SPSs are limited to sharing the ML model they learn after efficiently measuring their local data quality, whereas TPRs can verify the participants' uploaded models and fairly compensate each participant for their contributions through rewards. Simulation results, drawn from realistic mircorgrid network log datasets, demonstrate that the proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art techniques by enhancing the security model and guaranteeing fair reward distributions.|

The switching capability is facilitated by the phase change material and the structure is optimized by machine learning. Our design not only advances the machine-learning-based development of metamaterials but also has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions and contribute to the goal of achieving carbon neutrality.|

The results show that despite radial bar charts are the most popular visualization for activity data on smartwatches, the users' preferences might be influenced by their familiarity with these charts. These findings from this survey will be valuable for designers, developers, and researchers who are interested in creating innovative and effective solutions for activity visualization on smartwatches.|
|**2024-07-01**|**Immutable in Principle Upgradeable by Design Exploratory Study of Smart Contract Upgradeability**|Ilham Qasse et.al.|[2407.01493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01493v1)|null|Smart contracts, known for their immutable nature to ensure trust via automated enforcement, have evolved to require upgradeability due to unforeseen vulnerabilities and the need for feature enhancements post-deployment. This contradiction between immutability and the need for modifications has led to the development of upgradeable smart contracts. These contracts are immutable in principle yet upgradable by design, allowing updates without altering the underlying data or state, thus preserving the contract's intent while allowing improvements. This study aims to understand the application and implications of upgradeable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By introducing a dataset that catalogs the versions and evolutionary trajectories of smart contracts, the research explores key dimensions: the prevalence and adoption patterns of upgrade mechanisms, the likelihood and occurrences of contract upgrades, the nature of modifications post-upgrade, and their impact on user engagement and contract activity. Through empirical analysis, this study identifies upgradeable contracts and examines their upgrade history to uncover trends, preferences, and challenges associated with modifications. The evidence from analyzing over 44 million contracts shows that only 3% have upgradeable characteristics, with only 0.34% undergoing upgrades. This finding underscores a cautious approach by developers towards modifications, possibly due to the complexity of upgrade processes or a preference for maintaining stability. Furthermore, the study shows that upgrades are mainly aimed at feature enhancement and vulnerability mitigation, particularly when the contracts' source codes are accessible. However, the relationship between upgrades and user activity is complex, suggesting that additional factors significantly affect the use of smart contracts beyond their evolution.|
|**2024-07-01**|**The regularity of ODEs and thimble integrals with respect to Borel summation**|Veronica Fantini et.al.|[2407.01412v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01412v1)|null|Through Borel summation, one can often reconstruct an analytic solution of a problem from its asymptotic expansion. We view the effectiveness of Borel summation as a regularity property of the solution, and we show that the solutions of certain differential equation and integration problems are regular in this sense. By taking a geometric perspective on the Laplace and Borel transforms, we also clarify why "Borel regular" solutions are associated with special points on the Borel plane. The particular classes of problems we look at are level 1 ODEs and exponential period integrals over one dimensional Lefschetz thimbles. To expand the variety of examples available in the literature, we treat various examples of these problems in detail.|

At its core, it is about building software that is secure in composition with untrusted code, a challenge that extends far beyond blockchains. We introduce SCIF, a language for building smart contracts that are compositionally secure. SCIF is based on the fundamentally compositional principle of secure information flow, but extends this core mechanism to include protection against reentrancy attacks, confused deputy attacks, and improper error handling, even in the presence of malicious contracts that do not follow SCIF's rules. SCIF supports a rich ecosystem of interacting principals with partial trust through its mechanisms for dynamic trust management. SCIF has been implemented as a compiler to Solidity. We describe the SCIF language, including its static checking rules and runtime. Finally, we implement several applications with intricate security reasoning, showing how SCIF supports building complex smart contracts securely and gives programmer accurate diagnostics about potential security bugs.|

As one of Ethereum's core applications, smart contracts utilize diverse contract codes to meet various functional needs and have gained widespread use. However, the non-tamperability of smart contracts, coupled with vulnerabilities caused by natural flaws or human errors, has brought unprecedented challenges to blockchain security. Therefore, in order to ensure the healthy development of blockchain technology and the stability of the blockchain community, it is particularly important to study the vulnerability detection techniques for smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view Aware Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Framework named DVDet. The framework initially converts the source code and bytecode of smart contracts into weighted graphs and control flow sequences, capturing potential risk features from these two perspectives and integrating them for analysis, ultimately achieving effective contract vulnerability detection. Comprehensive experiments on the Ethereum dataset show that our method outperforms others in detecting vulnerabilities.|

To emulate these in aerial robots weighing less than a gram, known as flying insect robots (FIRs), a fast and responsive control system is essential. To date, these have largely been, at their core, elaborations of proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type feedback control. Without exception, their gains have been painstakingly tuned by hand. Aggressive maneuvers have further required task-specific tuning. Optimal control has the potential to mitigate these issues, but has to date only been demonstrated using approxiate models and receding horizon controllers (RHC) that are too computationally demanding to be carried out onboard the robot. Here we used a more accurate stroke-averaged model of forces and torques to implement the first demonstration of optimal control on an FIR that is computationally efficient enough to be performed by a microprocessor carried onboard. We took force and torque measurements from a 150 mg FIR, the UW Robofly, using a custom-built sensitive force-torque sensor, and validated them using motion capture data in free flight. We demonstrated stable hovering (RMS error of about 4 cm) and trajectory tracking maneuvers at translational velocities up to 25 cm/s using an optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR). These results were enabled by a more accurate model and lay the foundation for future work that uses our improved model and optimal controller in conjunction with recent advances in low-power receding horizon control to perform accurate aggressive maneuvers without iterative, task-specific tuning.|

Unlike commercial health apps for wearables, our system offers a comprehensive statistical analysis component that discovers correlations and trends in user data, allowing users to ask questions in natural language and receive generated personalized insights, and guides them to develop actionable goals. As a case study, we focus on improving sleep quality, given its measurability through physiological data and its importance to general well-being. Through a user study with 24 Fitbit watch users, we demonstrate that PhysioLLM outperforms both the Fitbit App alone and a generic LLM chatbot in facilitating a deeper, personalized understanding of health data and supporting actionable steps toward personal health goals.|

In this paper, we propose an autotuning-based optimization framework to quantify the ranges of hyperparameters in SVMs to identify their optimal choices, and apply the framework to two SVMs with the mixed-kernel between Sigmoid and Gaussian kernels for smart pixel datasets in high energy physics (HEP) and mixed-kernel heterojunction transistors (MKH). Our experimental results show that the optimal selection of hyperparameters in the SVMs and the kernels greatly varies for different applications and datasets, and choosing their optimal choices is critical for a high classification accuracy of the mixed kernel SVMs. Uninformed choices of hyperparameters C and coef0 in the mixed-kernel SVMs result in severely low accuracy, and the proposed framework effectively quantifies the proper ranges for the hyperparameters in the SVMs to identify their optimal choices to achieve the highest accuracy 94.6\% for the HEP application and the highest average accuracy 97.2\% with far less tuning time for the MKH application.|

ConvoCache finds a semantically similar prompt in the past and reuses the response. In this paper we evaluate ConvoCache on the DailyDialog dataset. We find that ConvoCache can apply a UniEval coherence threshold of 90% and respond to 89% of prompts using the cache with an average latency of 214ms, replacing LLM and voice synthesis that can take over 1s. To further reduce latency we test prefetching and find limited usefulness. Prefetching with 80% of a request leads to a 63% hit rate, and a drop in overall coherence. ConvoCache can be used with any chatbot to reduce costs by reducing usage of generative AI by up to 89%.|

However, there is a lack of research focused on predicting and developing application systems using clinical notes and blood test values. We collected five years of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from Taiwan's hospital database between 2017 and 2021 as an AI database. Furthermore, we developed an EHR-based chronic disease prediction platform utilizing Large Language Multimodal Models (LLMMs), successfully integrating with frontend web and mobile applications for prediction. This prediction platform can also connect to the hospital's backend database, providing physicians with real-time risk assessment diagnostics. The demonstration link can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqmL9DEDFgA.|
|**2024-06-26**|**A ContextDriven Approach for CoAuditing Smart Contracts with The Support of GPT4 code interpreter**|Mohamed Salah Bouafif et.al.|[2406.18075v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18075v1)|null|The surge in the adoption of smart contracts necessitates rigorous auditing to ensure their security and reliability. Manual auditing, although comprehensive, is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the auditor's expertise. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging them to assist auditors in the auditing process (co-auditing). However, the effectiveness of LLMs in smart contract co-auditing is contingent upon the design of the input prompts, especially in terms of context description and code length. This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing. Our approach employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, encompassing code scoping to chunk long code into self-contained code segments based on code inter-dependencies, assessment scoping to enhance context description based on the target assessment goal, thereby limiting the search space, and reporting scoping to force a specific format for the generated response. Through empirical evaluations on publicly available vulnerable contracts, our method demonstrated a detection rate of 96\% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53\%. To assess the reliability of our prompting approach, manual analysis of the results was conducted by expert auditors from our partner, Quantstamp, a world-leading smart contract auditing company. The experts' analysis indicates that, in unlabeled datasets, our proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities.|

In this paper, we present Smart Money, an infrastructure capability for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) which enables real-time Value Added Tax split payments, oversight, controlled access and smart policy implementation. This capability is implemented as a prototype, called Making Tax Smart (MTS), which is based on the open source R3 Corda framework. The results presented herein confirm that it is feasible to build a MTS capability which is scalable and co-exists with the current payment systems. Smart Money CBDC has the potential to mobilise payments data in order to transform the role of money from a blunt instrument to a government policy sensor and actuator without disrupting the existing money system. DLT, smart contracts and programmable money have a crucial role to play with benefits for government departments, the economy and society as a whole.|

CCF powers Microsoft's Azure Confidential Ledger service and as such it is vital to build confidence in the correctness of CCF's design and implementation. This paper reports our experiences applying smart casual verification to validate the correctness of CCF's novel distributed protocols, focusing on its unique distributed consensus protocol and its custom client consistency model. We use the term smart casual verification to describe our hybrid approach, which combines the rigor of formal specification and model checking with the pragmatism of automated testing, in our case binding the formal specification in TLA+ to the C++ implementation. While traditional formal methods approaches require substantial buy-in and are often one-off efforts by domain experts, we have integrated our smart casual verification approach into CCF's continuous integration pipeline, allowing contributors to continuously validate CCF as it evolves. We describe the challenges we faced in applying smart casual verification to a complex existing codebase and how we overcame them to find subtle bugs in the design and implementation before they could impact production.|

However, previous attempts still struggle with stochastic inference, conflicting with the deterministic nature of the Image2Normal task, and costly ensembling step, which slows down the estimation process. Our method, StableNormal, mitigates the stochasticity of the diffusion process by reducing inference variance, thus producing "Stable-and-Sharp" normal estimates without any additional ensembling process. StableNormal works robustly under challenging imaging conditions, such as extreme lighting, blurring, and low quality. It is also robust against transparent and reflective surfaces, as well as cluttered scenes with numerous objects. Specifically, StableNormal employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, which starts with a one-step normal estimator (YOSO) to derive an initial normal guess, that is relatively coarse but reliable, then followed by a semantic-guided refinement process (SG-DRN) that refines the normals to recover geometric details. The effectiveness of StableNormal is demonstrated through competitive performance in standard datasets such as DIODE-indoor, iBims, ScannetV2 and NYUv2, and also in various downstream tasks, such as surface reconstruction and normal enhancement. These results evidence that StableNormal retains both the "stability" and "sharpness" for accurate normal estimation. StableNormal represents a baby attempt to repurpose diffusion priors for deterministic estimation. To democratize this, code and models have been publicly available in hf.co/Stable-X|

In that context, this paper explores how morphology impacts the learned tactical behavior of unmanned aerial/ground robots performing reconnaissance and search & rescue. This is achieved by presenting a computationally efficient framework to solve this otherwise challenging problem of jointly optimizing the morphology and tactical behavior of swarm robots. Key novel developments to this end include the use of physical talent metrics and modification of graph reinforcement learning architectures to allow joint learning of the swarm tactical policy and the talent metrics (search speed, flight range, and cruising speed) that constrain mobility and object/victim search capabilities of the aerial robots executing these tactics. Implementation of this co-design approach is supported by advancements to an open-source Pybullet-based swarm simulator that allows the use of variable aerial asset capabilities. The results of the co-design are observed to outperform those of tactics learning with a fixed Pareto design, when compared in terms of mission performance metrics. Significant differences in morphology and learned behavior are also observed by comparing the baseline design and the co-design outcomes.|

Unfortunately, many children and youth from low-income families are unable to engage in this sport mainly due to financial constraints such as private lesson expenses as well as logistical concerns to and back from such lessons and clinics. While several tennis self-training systems exist, they are often tailored for professionals and are prohibitively expensive. The present study aims to classify tennis players' skill levels and classify tennis strokes into phases characterized by motion attributes for a future development of an AI-based tennis self-training model for affordable and convenient applications running on devices used in daily life such as an iPhone or an Apple Watch for tennis skill improvement. We collected motion data, including Motion Yaw, Roll and Pitch from inertial measurement units (IMUs) worn by participating junior tennis players. For this pilot study, data from twelve participants were processed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The SVM models demonstrated an overall accuracy of 77% in classifying players as beginners or intermediates, with low rates of false positives and false negatives, effectively distinguishing skill levels. Additionally, the tennis swings were successfully classified into five phases based on the collected motion data. These findings indicate that SVM-based classification can be a reliable foundation for developing an equitable and accessible AI-driven tennis training system.|

Executing smart contracts requires gas costs paid by users, which define the limits of the contract's execution. Logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to financial losses, and are often the root cause of high-impact cyberattacks. Our objective is threefold: (i) empirically investigate logic vulnerabilities in real-world smart contracts extracted from code changes on GitHub, (ii) introduce Soley, an automated method for detecting logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) examine mitigation strategies employed by smart contract developers to address these vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios. We obtained smart contracts and related code changes from GitHub. To address the first and third objectives, we qualitatively investigated available logic vulnerabilities using an open coding method. We identified these vulnerabilities and their mitigation strategies. For the second objective, we extracted various logic vulnerabilities, applied preprocessing techniques, and implemented and trained the proposed Soley model. We evaluated Soley along with the performance of various LLMs and compared the results with the state-of-the-art baseline on the task of logic vulnerability detection. From our analysis, we identified nine novel logic vulnerabilities, extending existing taxonomies with these vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we introduced several mitigation strategies extracted from observed developer modifications in real-world scenarios. Our Soley method outperforms existing methods in automatically identifying logic vulnerabilities. Interestingly, the efficacy of LLMs in this task was evident without requiring extensive feature engineering.|

Cross-chain bridge is a specific type of decentralized application for asset exchange across different blockchain platforms. Securing the smart contracts of cross-chain bridges is in urgent need, as there are a number of recent security incidents with heavy financial losses caused by vulnerabilities in bridge smart contracts, as we call them Cross-Chain Vulnerabilities (CCVs). However, automatically identifying CCVs in smart contracts poses several unique challenges. Particularly, it is non-trivial to (1) identify application-specific access control constraints needed for cross-bridge asset exchange, and (2) identify inconsistent cross-chain semantics between the two sides of the bridge.   In this paper, we propose SmartAxe, a new framework to identify vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridge smart contracts. Particularly, to locate vulnerable functions that have access control incompleteness, SmartAxe models the heterogeneous implementations of access control and finds necessary security checks in smart contracts through probabilistic pattern inference. Besides, SmartAxe constructs cross-chain control-flow graph (xCFG) and data-flow graph (xDFG), which help to find semantic inconsistency during cross-chain data communication. To evaluate SmartAxe, we collect and label a dataset of 88 CCVs from real-attacks cross-chain bridge contracts. Evaluation results show that SmartAxe achieves a precision of 84.95% and a recall of 89.77%. In addition, SmartAxe successfully identifies 232 new/unknown CCVs from 129 real-world cross-chain bridge applications (i.e., from 1,703 smart contracts). These identified CCVs affect a total amount of digital assets worth 1,885,250 USD.|

One of the unique designs in Solidity smart contracts is its state-reverting mechanism for error handling and access control. Unfortunately, a number of recent security incidents showed that adversaries also utilize this mechanism to manipulate critical states of smart contracts, and hence, bring security consequences such as illegal profit-gain and Deny-of-Service (DoS). In this paper, we call such vulnerabilities as the State-reverting Vulnerability (SRV). Automatically identifying SRVs poses unique challenges, as it requires an in-depth analysis and understanding of the state-dependency relations in smart contracts.   This paper presents SmartState, a new framework for detecting state-reverting vulnerability in Solidity smart contracts via fine-grained state-dependency analysis. SmartState integrates a set of novel mechanisms to ensure its effectiveness. Particularly, Smart-State extracts state dependencies from both contract bytecode and historical transactions. Both of them are critical for inferring dependencies related to SRVs. Further, SmartState models the generic patterns of SRVs (i.e., profit-gain and DoS) as SRV indicators, and hence effectively identify SRVs based on the constructed state-dependency graph. To evaluate SmartState, we manually annotated a ground-truth dataset which contains 91 SRVs in the real world. Evaluation results showed that SmartState achieves a precision of 87.23% and a recall of 89.13%. In addition, SmartState successfully identifies 406 new SRVs from 47,351 real-world smart contracts. 11 of these SRVs are from popular smart contracts with high transaction amounts (i.e., top 2000). In total, our reported SRVs affect a total amount of digital assets worth 428,600 USD.|

Current weakly-supervised models often use heuristics or assumptions methods to infer information from weak labels without taking advantage of the inherent clues of weakly-supervised and fully-supervised methods, thus it is difficult to explore a method that combines data utilization efficiency and model accuracy. In an attempt to address these issues, we propose a novel plug-and-in point cloud feature representation network called Multi-scale Mixed Attention (MMA). MMA utilizes adjacency attention within neighborhoods and disparity attention at different density scales to build a feature representation network. The smart feature representation obtained from MMA has shape tendency and object existence area inference, which can constrain the region of the detection boxes, thereby alleviating the problems caused by the information default of weak labels. Extensive experiments show that in indoor weak label scenarios, the fully-supervised network can perform close to that of the weakly-supervised network merely through the improvement of point feature by MMA. At the same time, MMA can turn waste into treasure, reversing the label jitter problem that originally interfered with weakly-supervised detection into the source of data enhancement, strengthening the performance of existing weak supervision detection methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/hzx-9894/MMA.|

Prior works generate mnemonics for students, but they do not guide models toward mnemonics students prefer and aid learning. We build SMART, a mnemonic generator trained on feedback from real students learning new terms. To train SMART, we first fine-tune LLaMA-2 on a curated set of user-written mnemonics. We then use LLM alignment to enhance SMART: we deploy mnemonics generated by SMART in a flashcard app to find preferences on mnemonics students favor. We gather 2684 preferences from 45 students across two types: expressed (inferred from ratings) and observed (inferred from student learning), yielding three key findings. First, expressed and observed preferences disagree; what students think is helpful does not fully capture what is truly helpful. Second, Bayesian models can synthesize complementary data from multiple preference types into a single effectiveness signal. SMART is tuned via Direct Preference Optimization on this signal, which we show resolves ties and missing labels in the typical method of pairwise comparisons, augmenting data for LLM output quality gains. Third, mnemonic experts assess SMART as matching GPT-4, at much lower deployment costs, showing the utility of capturing diverse student feedback to align LLMs in education.|

Mortazavi et.al.|[2406.15110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15110v1)|null|This paper proposes a voxel-based approach for creating a digital twin of an urban environment that is capable of efficiently managing smart spaces. The paper explains the registration and localization procedure of the point cloud dataset, which uses the KISS ICP for scan point cloud combination and the RANSAC method for the initial alignment of the combined point cloud. The mobile mapping point cloud using Riegl VMX-250 serves as the reference map, and Velodyne scans are used for localization purposes. The point-to-plane iterative closest-point method is then employed to refine the alignment. The paper evaluates the efficacy of the proposed method by calculating the errors between the estimated and ground truth positions. The results indicate that the voxel-based approach is capable of accurately estimating the position of the sensor platform, which are applicable for various use cases. A specific use case in the context is smart parking space management, which is described and initial visualization results are shown.|
